Create a responsive card layout that displays a list of products. Each card should contain:

Card Structure:

An image of the product.
Product title.
Short description.
Price.
A button to "Add to Cart".
Flexbox Layout:

Use Flexbox to arrange the cards in a row.
The cards should wrap onto the next line as the viewport shrinks.
Ensure that the cards are evenly spaced and centered on the page.
Responsive Design:

On smaller screens (like mobile devices), the cards should stack vertically instead of horizontally.
Ensure that each card maintains a consistent height and width.
Styling:

Use a simple color scheme and typography to make the cards visually appealing.
Add hover effects on the cards and the "Add to Cart" button.
